Receiver 2 Buttplug.io mod. Vibrates sex toys depending on in game events. Currently vibrates on player shoot, explosion, holster discharge, getting shot, getting shocked. Requires Intiface Desktop (https://intiface.com/desktop/). Run the server before loading the game, connect any devices, then press 'Control Devices' to start the server. The server runs on localhost:54321 and connects to Intiface at localhost:12345. Building the server requires buttplug-rs-ffi (https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi). To load the mod, place Wolfire.Receiver2.dll at 'Receiver 2/Receiver2_Data/Managed/' and overwrite the default one. Be sure to back up the original first! Because this mod was made by editing the source code, it may not work after an update.
